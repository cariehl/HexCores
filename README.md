# HexCores #
**HexCores** is a mod for **Slay the Spire** that adds three new uncommon relics. Inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/7uika3/relic_conceptideas_hexagonal_cores/) by /u/Sweet_Azu over on /r/SlayTheSpire.

## Description ##

The hex cores provide power for over-committing to defense. Each core has a different effect if you start your turn with 10 or more Block, after taking damage from enemies.

The three cores are:

* Amplify Core - If you have 10 or more Block at the start of your turn, deal 10 damage to ALL enemies.
* Bulk Core - If you have 10 or more Block at the start of your turn, gain 2 Strength.
* Transform Core - If you have 10 or more Block at the start of your turn, gain 2 Energy.

I am not an artist, so the artwork for the cores is currently pretty bad. Anyone who wants to create better art for these relics is welcome to do so!

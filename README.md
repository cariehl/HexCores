# HexCores #
**HexCores** is a mod for **Slay the Spire** that adds three new uncommon relics. Inspired by /u/Sweet_Azu over on /r/SlayTheSpire.

## Description ##

The hex cores provide power for committing to defense. Each core has a different effect if you start your turn with 10 or more Block, after surviving enemy attacks.

The three cores are:

* Amplify Core - If you have 10 or more Block at the start of your turn, deal 5 damage to ALL enemies.
* Bulk Core - If you have 10 or more Block at the start of your turn, gain 1 Strength.
* Transformer Core - If you have 10 or more Block at the start of your turn, gain 1 Energy.

I am not an artist, so none of the cores currently have artwork associated with them. Anyone who wants to create art for these relics is welcome to do so!
